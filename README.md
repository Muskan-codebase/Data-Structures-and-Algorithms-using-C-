# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using C++ – Practice Repository

Hi 👋

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository. This repository contains my implementations of fundamental DSA concepts, written for **learning, clarity, and strong conceptual understanding**. Each topic is implemented from scratch with a focus on how and *why* the algorithm works.

This repository reflects my journey of building a solid foundation in DSA, which is essential for problem-solving, interviews, and core computer science understanding.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms

* **Linear Search**
  Searches each element one by one until the target is found.

* **Binary Search**
  Efficient searching technique that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search space into half.

---

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms

* **Bubble Sort**
  Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

* **Selection Sort**
  Selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and places it at the correct position.

* **Insertion Sort**
  Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

### 📚 Stack

* Implementation of **Stack** using arrays
* Follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle
* Operations implemented:

  * Push
  * Pop
  * Peek
  * isEmpty
  * isFull

---

### 🚦 Queue

* **Linear Queue** implementation using arrays
* **Circular Queue** implementation to overcome space wastage
* Follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle
* Operations implemented:

  * Enqueue
  * Dequeue
  * isEmpty
  * isFull
  * Display

---

### 🔗 Linked List

* **Singly Linked List** implementation
* Node-based dynamic data structure
* Operations implemented:

  * Insertion
  * Deletion
  * Traversal
