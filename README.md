# Data Structures & Algorithms using C++

This repository contains my learning and implementation of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
- Practice problem-solving using C++
- Prepare for coding interviews and placements
- Maintain clean, well-structured, and readable code
